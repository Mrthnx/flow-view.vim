# nvim-flowview

A modern Neovim plugin to **visually understand code flow** through nested inline function expansion.

This repository is currently a scaffold for the MVP described in `FLOWVIEW.md`.

## Development

```vim
:FlowView
```

The command is wired but currently renders a placeholder panel. See `FLOWVIEW.md` for the
planned architecture and behavior.
